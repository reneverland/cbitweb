						<h3>The Impact of R&D on Consumer Perceptions of Financial Products: Evidence from the "Digital Wallet" Industry</h3>
						<p>New product design and development is more often than not a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In an industry that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary due to continuous technology change and development as well as other competitors and the changing preference of customers. Without an R&D program, a firm must rely on strategic alliances, acquisitions, and networks to tap into the innovations of others.</p>
						<p>Digital payments and payment containers (typically called “wallets”) have been an area of intense innovation over the past decade.  Indeed the proliferation of payment methods, patented technologies and technical innovations far exceeds the last great period of payments innovation in the 1960s when Diners Club, Visa and MasterCard vastly expanded their offerings. </p>
						<P>The current research answers basic questions regarding the dynamic processes governing IP protection, innovation law, market structure and evolution: in particular rates or entry and exit.  The research collected 449,145 twitter postings on consumer perceptions of digital wallet payment systems.  Automated lexical analysis was programmed for this research question, and applied to individual tweets to extract consumer sentiment.</P>
						<P>We found that patented R&D on customer-facing technologies (Bluetooth, SMS and QR codes) all increase the level and intensity of conversation on Twitter.  Patents related to architecture (SIM, SMS, RFID, barcodes) are not talked about (at least on general forums like Twitter; the story would probably be different at developer forums).</P>
