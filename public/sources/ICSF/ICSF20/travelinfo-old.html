It was called “stone wall entering the sea” which was built by Qijiguang who was the commander of the garrison troops in the Ming Dynasty. The huge stone wall looks like a dragon’s head poking into the sea. Old Dragon Head consists of stone wall entering the sea, Jinglutai, Nanhaikouguan, and Chenghailou. The tower of Chenghailou was first built in the Ming Dynasty. There are two horizontal inscribed boards hung on the Chenghailou, one of which was written by Sun Chengzong, a high official of the Ming and the other was written by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing.
