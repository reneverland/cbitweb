						<h3>Speech Title： Technology-Driven Creative Destruction: How the Covid-19 Crisis Acts as a Catalyst and Accelerator forBbusiness Transformation across Industries and Economies</h3>
						<p><b>Abstract</b>: Since the beginning of 2020 the COVID 19 pandemic has been wreaking havoc on businesses and societies around the world, leading to economic recessions and depressions, sharpening socio-economic inequalities, and incurring devastating human costs in many countries. This talk will offer a perspective based on the concept of Schumpeterian creative destruction and argue that the post-pandemic world will never return to the old normal but rather find a new and much different normal with a radically reconfigured economy where newly efficient organizations largely replace old ones that failed to adapt either because of structural deficiencies or strategic miscalculation. This economic reconfiguration can be best viewed as a cycle of creative destruction that was triggered by the covid-19 crises forcing organizations to adapt and innovate. Looking at the type of businesses that are struggling and those that are resilient and thrive we find that technology is the principle driver for successful business transformation and in many cases are accelerating change processes that had already begun long before the crisis. We will discuss examples from different industries, focusing particularly on financial services, tech, education and highlighting how technology is shaping the creative destruction process. We conclude with some thoughts on open questions and new challenges.</p>
