						<p><b>Abstract</b>: It is not too much of stretch to realize that the banking industry is going through a disruption period. Banks globally cut over 75,000 jobs in 2019 alone. Led by AI and Blockchain technologies, all the traditional functional areas of the banking services are being transformed, from depositing, wealth management, financial advising to investing.  Professor Eric Zheng will discuss the challenges and opportunities enabled by Blockchain for the banking services, including DCEP, open finance, De-Fi, micropayment, and supply chain finance etc.</p>
