						<p><b>Abstract</b>: Although technology is value-neutral itself, the application of technology, say FinTech, can either create economic value or destroy it, depending on how the technology is deployed in the operations of business. This talk will give a new perspective to view FinTech and its impact, based on the basic logic of financial system composed of financial assets/products, markets, and intermediate institutes. It is shown that FinTech can create more diversified new financial business, and be of great help in increasing the value and efficiency of financial operations, when aligning with the logic. Also, FinTech can serve as microscope to let us have more and detailed look to real world financial phenomena, and, therefore, have more opportunities to explore the new research territory of Finance.</p>
