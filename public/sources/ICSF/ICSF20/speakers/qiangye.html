						<h3>Speech Title： It Depends on When You Search!</h3>
						<p><b>Abstract</b>: Existing studies propose Internet search activity as a direct and timely measure of investor attention. This study explores search time heterogeneity to capture different types of cognitive tasks behind search. Weekends afford retail investors more time for the type of deliberate and persistent search that is essential in planning trading actions, while work and market fluctuations during weekdays prompt more casual and transient search. Using the daily search volume index (SVI) from Google Trends and Baidu index, this study distinguishes online searches on weekends from weekdays and show that weekend search is more powerful in predicting stock returns. The predictive power of weekend search is stronger in the absence of surges in transient search volume. The findings are consistent with the notion that weekend search is more deliberate and persistent, and thus better captures retail investor attention that leads to trading action.</p>
