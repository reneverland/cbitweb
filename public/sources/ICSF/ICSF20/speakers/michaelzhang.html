						<h3>Speech Title： Market Uncertainties and Prediction of Rare Events: With an Application to Financial Market Crashes</h3>
						<p><b>Abstract</b>: Over the last two decades, big data and machine learning models achieved tremendous success in offering empirical insights in various fields of management science. While such methods are often very powerful in making predictions, they face two main challenges: (1) there is no guarantee that the underlying distribution will remain the same in the future, and (2) such models often fail to make predictions of rare events. This study aims to examine how uncertainties can be measured and demonstrate how the solution of the first issue can contribute to the examination of the second. Our setting is the financial market. Black swan events such as market crashes have significant impacts, but they do not happen very often. Given the rare nature of stock market crashes, machine learning models are not reliable. We discuss how ambiguity can be a measure of market uncertainty to examine financial market deviation from the fundamentals. We propose a measure of ambiguity and examine how it can be used to complement data-driven prediction models. We find that, under certain conditions, when the distribution of observed returns become closer to normal, the market is actually further away from the fundamentals. This new measure works remarkably well in demonstrating financial market deviations over the course of the past 30 years, and was able to offer warning signals to major stock market crashes including the recent one in February and March of 2020.</p>
