						<h3>Speech Title： The Framework of CAFÉ Hologram Risk Assessment and Applications in Financial Technology (Fintech)</h3>
						<p><b>Abstract</b>: By following the big data thinking in financial technology (Fintech) and combining Gibbs sampling algorithm in artificial intelligence (AI), we first share how we establish a new assessment system called CAFÉ evaluation system based on our four dimensional holograms, which is applied for risk assessment for enterprises and companies in line with China's actual situation. As applications, we will also share: 1.How the main credit risk rating system for more than 4000 domestic enterprises / companies looks like; 2.How we design a new type of equity products based on "value investment" of companies; 3.How combining with the capital structure theory of Modigliani and Miller (MM) in finance, the credit evaluation system of bonds in capital market is established; plus Combined with the events from the second half of 2019, we share the case analysis and sharing of credit risk based on financial fraud, default and bankruptcy of listed companies and poor financial quality of companies.
