She held that universities had four basic functions of Teaching, Research, Service and Communication. She advocated a three dimensional KAP (Knowledge, Ability and Personality) module of education and created pioneering concepts in the internationalization of higher education. In the university management practice, she managed to focus on the quality of undergraduate programs and to enhance the research competence through postgraduate programs. She adopted an international policy for the University to maintain its traditional relation with Germany and to expand its partnership worldwide. She encouraged academic integration among different fields and interdisciplinary network so as to form integrated academic advantages of the University. During her eight years in presidency, the University experienced its prime time of development: its student number doubled from 27,000 to 56,000, among which postgraduate student number increased by three times; its research funds were three times more, ranking No. five/ six among Chinese universities; its PhD and Master's programs and state key disciplines were twice as many as before.</p>
						<p>Professor WU Obtained her BSc in Radio Engineering from the Department of Radio and Electronic Engineering of Tsinghua University, China, her MSc in Automatic Control from the Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, China and her Ph.D. in Automation from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland. She does academic research in control theory and intelligent system for many years. She published more than 200 academic papers, wrote and interpreted seven books and completed over twenty research projects, seven of which won Provincial, Ministerial and State awards.</p>
						<p>Because of her outstanding work, she was rewarded with a number awards including an Outstanding Young and Middle-aged Expert Award from the Ministry of Personnel in 1996; an Excellent Overseas Returned Scholar Award in 1997 and a National Ten Outstanding Women Award in 1998.
